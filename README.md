### TASK A: Monologue
* Duration: 15' for preparation + 3-4' for execution.
    - Never more that 4' for execution.
* Recommended organisation:
    1. **Introduction**

    - I can use a watch to know the time.

### TASK B: Dialogue

* Duration: 8-9' in total.
* Temporal distribution (going from concrete to abstract):
    1. **Description**: Tell the common denominator of the 4 given images, and the start speaking about 2. Do **NOT** describe the photos (never say "I can see a...").
    2. **Narration**: Past, present **or** future. Sample question: "Which one is more relatable?".
    3. **Opinion**: Sample question: "What makes a good classroom?". From this point I should expect being under *heavy fire*.
    4. **Argumentation**: It can intertwine with the opinion point, or if there is no luck, they will resort to other questions.
