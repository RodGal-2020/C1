Yes, there is a separate document for the grammar.

## Fronting

## Cleft-sentence

## Prepositions

- **Suggest**:
    - She suggested not smoking as a way to bla bla bla.
    - The dr. suggested that he should do exercise.
    - The dr. suggested that he eat/ate better. (The latter uses a subjunctive statement).
    - The dr. suggests that she *not eat/didn't eat* better. (The latter uses a subjunctive statement & the problem with this is present actions).
    - She advised me not to smoke.
    - (Suggest + Inf) NUNCA.
    - NUNCA ~~~He suggested her to go~~ -> He suggested that she should go. (W/ "advised" we can say "he advised her to go").
- **Remember**:
    - To take: Pensarlo y hacerlo.
    - Taking: Algo que ocurriÃ³ en el pasado.
- **Enjoy**:
    - To go.
